    # The earl and countess lie in stone,
    # Their proper habits vaguely shown
    # As jointed armour, stiffened pleat,
    # And that faint hint of the absurdâ€”

    # The little dogs under their feet.

    # Such plainness of the pre-baroque
    # Hardly involves the eye, until
    # It meets his left-hand gauntlet, still
    # Clasped empty in the other; and
    # One sees, with a sharp tender shock,

    # His hand withdrawn, holding her hand.
